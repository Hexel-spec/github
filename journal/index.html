            <h2>Post #2: Overlay Design</h2>
            <p>
                Recently, I read Kathryn Whitenton’s article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> from 2015. It’s all about the different ways that overlays are misused to cause users to become confused and/or frustrated, and how to properly implement them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first thing I learned from this article is that “lightbox” is another term for overlay. According to the author, this is because oftentimes the rest of the page is obscured while the overlay is active, illuminating the overlay as a result. I don't think I’m fond of this term though; it’s based on a design standard that isn’t always in use and isn’t as useful in conveying meaning as “overlay”. Still, it was an interesting piece of information to learn about. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The advice Whitenton gives for implementing overlays is pretty intuitive: don’t overload the overlay with so much content it needs to scroll, make sure it’s actually visible on the page regardless of the viewport, include a clear button label to allow the user to exit out easily, etc. I appreciated the point about how we should approach the design from the user’s perspective when determining the time and place for overlays. Most importantly, overlays should not be used if the information/input present could easily be incorporated into the page itself. Overlays should only be used if there is a very important and urgent reason why the user needs to be obstructed.

            <h2>Post #1: Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19, 2026</time>
            <p>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari gives some practical pointers for making online forms user-friendly and easy to fill out. As this article points out, many people will quit filling out a form halfway through if they feel like it is too difficult or time consuming to make the effort worthwhile. Keeping the form design simple and straightforward in layout and language will ensure more users are willing to complete the form.
            </p>

            <p>
                As someone who doesn’t have a lot of experience with form design, I felt that this article did a good job in presenting its points in an understandable yet comprehensive way. One of the best practices that stood out to me was to avoid using placeholder text within the input field, as this text will disappear for users once they start typing. The author instead recommends putting the instructions and any hints near the input field, within the form itself. Another practice that stood out to me was to not make users type out their passwords twice, but instead allow them to unmask their password to make informed corrections. This stood out to me because I’ve had frustrations with retyping passwords in the past; and thought this was a more helpful option.
            </p>

            <p>
                A website form that I’ve recently filled out is the <a href="https://github.com/signup">Github sign up form</a>. While not perfect (there isn’t any way to check for password mistakes), it demonstrates many of the best practices mentioned in the article, including having instruction labels above the input fields, hints below the input fields, and stars indicating required fields.
