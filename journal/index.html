                I was given the image above by Grace Asuncion and asked to give my impressions on what it meant. The image appears to contain various items belonging to or used by Grace. The first thing that stood out to me was that while they have the appearance of being randomly strewn about, they are deliberately placed so that each individual item is visible. And they aren’t just a random assortment of items either; they all originate from Grace’s travels. Some are obvious, such as the tags from Super Nintendo World or images from Disneyland being clear indications she’s visited these places. Items like the airport ticket from Los Angeles to Sacramento or the elongated coin, a common souvenir item, require more in-depth visual thinking in order to determine meaning. I myself am not entirely sure of the significance of the beaded bracelet or the bottle cap. If I were to give suggestions on how to push the narratives and visual thinking present in this image, I would suggest including more items that require deduction to determine their origin, rather than explicitly stating where they are from. I would also suggest changing the background the items are laid on to something more thematically appropriate, such as a map or postboard.

                 The image above is interesting because it is a natural pool of water that my family discovered all on our own. My archive as a whole is based around various places in the Grover Hot Springs State Park area near South Lake Tahoe, and this particular pool is not advertised in any of their materials. This archive tells the story of the novel experiences we had in this place, from relaxing in the park’s hot spring area, to discovering the pool and dunking our heads underneath its small waterfalls, to observing the sooty texture of recently burnt trees. It was especially meaningful to me because many of these experiences were ones we sought out for ourselves. If I were to update my images to make them more compelling, I could perhaps provide a multi-sensory experience as my users zoom in and out of my images, such as playing video or audio of running streams.

            <h2>Post #3: Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>
            <p>
                I read <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</a> by Michael Gonchar of the New York Times. Gonchar pairs 10 tips for visual thinking with 10 striking photos. I noticed that for each of these photos, they were accompanied by the tagline “What’s going on in this picture?” Answering this question seems to be the driving purpose of the visual thinking skills that this article presents. I found the way different students critically engaged with the different photos to be really inspiring, from intentionally looking for details, to thinking about the actions and narrative that led to that snapshot, to collaborating with others to determine meaning. It encourages me to be more considerate of the images I see.

                While browsing through the <a href="http://Awwwards.com">Awwwards.com</a> website for more visual inspiration, I came across a website called <a href="https://fandomalbum.io/">Fandom</a>, which presents itself as “the World’s First Fan-Owned Album.” Its home page was a purple and black globe that you could spin around yourself by clicking and dragging, and it gave me the impression it was seeking to have a worldwide impact with its design. The main feature currently on display was the “Two Car Garage”, a three-dimensional environment where you click on certain points to zoom in and get samples of the song “Two Car Garage” and learn more about its artists. I was impressed at the 3D environment’s polish and detail, but I do think the spectacle of the environment muddied the purpose and organization of the webpage a little bit, as it wasn’t really clear to me at first.

            <h2>Post #2: Overlay Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 28, 2026</time>
            <p>
                Recently, I read Kathryn Whitenton’s article <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/">Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes</a> from 2015. It’s all about the different ways that overlays are misused to cause users to become confused and/or frustrated, and how to properly implement them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first thing I learned from this article is that “lightbox” is another term for overlay. According to the author, this is because oftentimes the rest of the page is obscured while the overlay is active, illuminating the overlay as a result. I don't think I’m fond of this term though; it’s based on a design standard that isn’t always in use and isn’t as useful in conveying meaning as “overlay”. Still, it was an interesting piece of information to learn about. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The advice Whitenton gives for implementing overlays is pretty intuitive: don’t overload the overlay with so much content it needs to scroll, make sure it’s actually visible on the page regardless of the viewport, include a clear button label to allow the user to exit out easily, etc. I appreciated the point about how we should approach the design from the user’s perspective when determining the time and place for overlays. Most importantly, overlays should not be used if the information/input present could easily be incorporated into the page itself. Overlays should only be used if there is a very important and urgent reason why the user needs to be obstructed.

            <h2>Post #1: Form Design</h2>
            <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19, 2026</time>
            <p>
                <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> by Salim Ansari gives some practical pointers for making online forms user-friendly and easy to fill out. As this article points out, many people will quit filling out a form halfway through if they feel like it is too difficult or time consuming to make the effort worthwhile. Keeping the form design simple and straightforward in layout and language will ensure more users are willing to complete the form.
            </p>

            <p>
                As someone who doesn’t have a lot of experience with form design, I felt that this article did a good job in presenting its points in an understandable yet comprehensive way. One of the best practices that stood out to me was to avoid using placeholder text within the input field, as this text will disappear for users once they start typing. The author instead recommends putting the instructions and any hints near the input field, within the form itself. Another practice that stood out to me was to not make users type out their passwords twice, but instead allow them to unmask their password to make informed corrections. This stood out to me because I’ve had frustrations with retyping passwords in the past; and thought this was a more helpful option.
            </p>

            <p>
                A website form that I’ve recently filled out is the <a href="https://github.com/signup">Github sign up form</a>. While not perfect (there isn’t any way to check for password mistakes), it demonstrates many of the best practices mentioned in the article, including having instruction labels above the input fields, hints below the input fields, and stars indicating required fields.
